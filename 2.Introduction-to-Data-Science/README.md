## Project 1: Solving Data Science Problems

This repository contains the first project for Udacity's [Data Scientist Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025).
Here you can find a step-by-step process to predict house prices of the Ames Housing dataset, where we could achieve a Top 27% of the leaderboard of this [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/).
Besides this notebook, you can find this [blog post](https://medium.com/@fmeister23/what-is-my-home-worth-what-every-homeowner-and-seller-should-know-9f9bb792c11a) with some soft technical language and focused on the business problem.


## Motivation

Buying or selling a home has never been an easy task, especially nowadays where we have plenty of choices and houses with many different variations.

It’s really important to know how much your house is worth because if you estimate your home’s value as too high, you could wind up sitting on the market. Otherwise, if you place it below market value, certainly you will end up losing money.

So, what’s the way out of this situation?

Your best bet is to know your home’s worth, and list your home close to the market value.

On the internet, we have plenty of sites that could estimate it for you based on your location: ZipRealty, Realtor, Redfin, and many others.

The main objective of this project is to go deeper into these questions:

- What are the aspects that have the most influence on the value of a home?
- Can we have a trustworthy estimate of the Homes Price?
- How could we estimate almost any houses price and transform this study into a product?

To answer these questions we are going to explore the Ames Housing dataset, which has almost 3000 houses prices with 79 explanatory variables that were directly related to property sales in Ames, Iowa. Some examples of questions that these variables answer:

When was it built? How big is the lot? How many square-feet of living space is in the dwelling? Is the basement finished? How many bathrooms are there?
